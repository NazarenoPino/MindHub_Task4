        <h4>General Information</h4>
        <p>
          The Mighty Ducks Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes
          residing Chicago's northside neighborhoods an environment in which to
          learn and play hockey. To be a member of MDHL, you must be between the
          ages of 4 - 12 and reside a Chicago northside neighborhood. MDHL ran by a
          small full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time of
          parents and previous league members.
